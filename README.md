# Banking-Data-Analysis-Using-Logistic-Regression
his project focuses on analyzing banking data to predict customer outcomes using Logistic Regression, a widely-used machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. Key aspects of the project include:

Data Collection: Utilizing a dataset that includes customer information, account details, transaction history, and demographic data.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables to prepare for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Employing Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize relationships and patterns in the data, helping to identify key features that impact customer behavior.
Model Development: Implementing Logistic Regression to predict binary outcomes, such as whether a customer will default on a loan or whether they will respond positively to a marketing campaign.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the ROC curve to understand its effectiveness in making predictions.
The project provides insights into customer behavior, enabling banks to make data-driven decisions regarding risk management, marketing strategies, and customer retention efforts.
